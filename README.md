# Pok√© Pong

The brief of the DevelopMe technical challenge was to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis touranment bracket from a list of names collected from the user. 

Optional advanced features may include:

* ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the touranment playoffs
* continued rounds created until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other, one marked as the winner)

This challenge was created using React and Redux. For more information on how to get set up and what to install please see below.
